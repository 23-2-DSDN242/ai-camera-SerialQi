## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This project delves into the world of AI-driven image processing and custom filters, with a focus on highlighting elements within photographs using computational algorithms.  I was inspired by a group photos i took in Queenstown about sheep shearing, I found that was really intersting.

The images above are photos of shaving sheep algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The mask in each photo highlights the sheep's process of being shaved, which is cute and funny.Using a modified version of the p5.js Pointillism example, I set out to algorithmically process the photos. Each image became a canvas for experimentation, as I fine-tuned masking techniques and algorithm parameters to achieve the desired visual impact.
