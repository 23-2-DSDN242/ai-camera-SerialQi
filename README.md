## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This project delves into the world of AI-driven image processing and custom filters, with a focus on highlighting elements within photographs using computational algorithms.  I was inspired by a group photos i took in Queenstown about sheep shearing, I found that was really intersting. My photo starts with a cartoon lamb on a brown background, then turns black and white photo, and finishes with dots and squares.

The images above are photos of shaving sheep algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The mask in each photo highlights the sheep's process of being shaved, which is cute and funny.Using a modified version of the p5.js Pointillism example, I set out to algorithmically process the photos. Each image became a canvas for experimentation, as I fine-tuned masking techniques and algorithm parameters to achieve the desired visual impact. 

## Design process 
Initially, I started by using a basic function to draw my image. And i saw in a class example,  the photo reduced brightness and then the colors gradually appeared, which I found fascinating, so i also want add similar effect to my work. I converted the image to grayscale. Using a loop, making the photo gradually appear.I converted each pixel of the photo to grayscale by adjusting the three colors in RGB, red, green and blue. Next, I gradually outlined the color of the photo with random circles and squares.
After completing these steps, I felt that the image was still a little monotonous. So, I decided to add another layer before the grayscale layer and draw some cartoon sheep. Initially, I wanted the sheep to appear randomly, but due to time constraints, I chose a regular grid pattern. Although I did the whole project in a hurry, but it was really interesting.
